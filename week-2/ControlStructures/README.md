# 🏦 Control Structures – Bank Scenarios

This project demonstrates how to use control structures in PL/SQL using real-world banking examples.


## 🚀 Scenarios

### ✅ 1. Interest Discount for Senior Citizens
- Loops through all customers.
- If a customer's age is **above 60**, reduce their loan interest rate by **1%**.

### ✅ 2. Promote Customers to VIP
- Loops through all customers.
- If a customer's balance is **greater than $10,000**, set `IsVIP = 'TRUE'`.

### ✅ 3. Loan Due Reminder
- Loops through all loans.
- If a loan's due date is **within the next 30 days**, print a reminder using `DBMS_OUTPUT`.
