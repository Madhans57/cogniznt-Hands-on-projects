# ðŸ’¹ Financial Forecasting Tool (Java)

This is a simple Java program that calculates the **future value of an investment** using both **recursive** and **iterative** approaches.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem

Predict the future value of an amount based on a fixed annual growth rate over a number of years.

Formula used:
Future Value = Present Value Ã— (1 + Growth Rate) ^ Years

## ðŸ§  Approaches Used

1. Recursive Approach
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (due to recursive call stack)


2. Iterative Approach
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

I prefer Iterative Approach since it is most efficient way.
On the other hand Recursive Approach is simple and elegent but it has more sapce complexity than Iterative Approach.
